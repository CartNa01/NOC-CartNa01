# IOG Architecture Triage - NOC as a service 

This service is defined as the NOC’s response time to requests.


## Overview

Throughout the day, the NOC receives SEV requests it’s the NOC’s responsibility to process each request individually and assist to the fullest extent of their (our) ability. Once a member of the NOC evaluates a SEV, alert, or notification, they must understand the situation and escalate the issue promptly.
## Feature Requests
The NOC primarily uses Tiger as a severity reporting tool. Compared to state-of-the-art tools that high revenue business are utilizing, tiger could be considered antiquated. Tiger is proprietary tool generated by Lexis Nexis employees which have been tailored to the NOC needs. With the usage of mainstream external tools (Jira, Cherwell, OpsGenie, or service now) this will provide the NOC with better reporting functionality.
